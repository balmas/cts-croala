# CTS URNs in CroALa

## The background

Contrary to the so-called "classical" Greek and Latin literature, the corpus of works preserved from the twelve centuries between 750 BC and 500 AD, the works of Neo-Latin literature lack a standard, canonical, wide-spread citation schemes, in the same way as Neo-Latin literature lacks a canon. For a digital collection this is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, there are no complicated, sometimes even conflicting or competing systems to be reproduced; on the other hand, it is a task of the collection editors to develop and implement a citation scheme which will be understandable to humans and actionable for machines.

Trying to solve this task for the Neo-Latin texts in the Croatiae auctores Latini, we propose the approach described below. We think that, though somewhat novel and different from classical citation schemes, the approach nevertheless remains within the limits of the CITE Architecture specification.
