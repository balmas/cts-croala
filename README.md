## The task

At the moment, [CroALa](https://github.com/nevenjovanovic/croatiae-auctores-latini-textus) contains 467 documents and over 5.7 million words.

Of the 467 documents, [443](docs/notcroalactsmulti.list) were easy to describe semi-automatically -- via [XQuery scripts](scripts/Scripts.md) -- according to CTS metadata requirements.  The rest (see [a list](docs/croalactsmulti.list)) have multiple authors or other issues.

As we are following the [CapiTainS guidelines](http://capitains.github.io/pages/guidelines#directory-structure) (to an extent), it has been necessary to rename files in the collection. There is a [concordance file](docs/croalactsconcordance.xml).

## Contents

+ The XML files and metadata are in [data](data)
+ The XQuery scripts used to produce this version are in [scripts](scripts), as well as their [description](scripts/Scripts.md)
+ Files with additional information are in [docs](docs)
